# Code editor
<p>The online code editor Project is a web based application which includes user interaction.
Our project is going to be a app portal. It is going to provide editing and compiling
environment for users. Every user have their own profile and they can have access with
given password to the system.</p>

<p>The scope of online code editors is rapidly expanding as more and more developers are
opting for cloud-based development tools. Online code editors are web-based applications that allow developers to write and edit code without having to download or install software on their local machines.</p>

<br></br>
<br></br>
## Future works
<br></br>
1. Create save file option for the uses who logged in.
<br></br>
2. Run and compile feature during collaborative coding.
<br></br>
3. Adding snippets and themes
<br></br>
4. Giving control for collaborative leader to save file.
